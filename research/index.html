	<p><span style="font-size: 26px">Are Uniform or Fragmented Carbon Taxes Optimal? Evidence
from Canadian Manufacturing (Draft coming soon!)</span>  </p>
  <p align="justify"> A uniform carbon tax applied to all emission sources is optimal when there are no other distortions.
Yet, observed carbon prices are highly fragmented both across and within countries, and multiple market
imperfections exist. Should jurisdictions work towards a global carbon price when markets are imperfect?
Using two confidential manufacturing plant-level datasets that span 18 years for Canada, I document
large and persistent differences in the relative carbon tax-inclusive price of electricity to fossil fuels across
space and time. Then, I build and estimate a quantitative model where firms choose their energy mix,
which includes a fossil fuel aggregate and electricity. Firms are heterogeneous in their productivity and
fossil fuel intensity, and regions have varying degrees of clean power. I apply the model to the Canadian
manufacturing sector to estimate the impact of carbon taxes on emissions and output. I find that uniform
carbon prices do not equalize the marginal abatement costs across regions, implying that the optimal
tax is not uniform. However, while optimal carbon taxes are highly fragmented, the costs of carbon tax
harmonization are small, with a 0.05 percentage point difference in output across both regimes.  <br>
