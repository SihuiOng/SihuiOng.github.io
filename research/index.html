	<p>Is a Uniform Carbon Tax Really Optimal? Evidence from Canadian Manufacturing (Draft coming soon!) </p>

Economic theory argues that a uniform carbon tax applied to all emission sources is optimal when there
are no other distortions. Yet, observed carbon prices are highly fragmented both across and within
countries, and multiple market imperfections exist. Should jurisdictions work towards a global carbon
price when markets are imperfect? Using two confidential manufacturing plant-level datasets that span
18 years for Canada, I document large and persistent differences in the relative carbon tax-inclusive
price of electricity to fossil fuels across space and time. Then, I build and estimate a quantitative model
where firms choose their energy mix, which includes a fossil fuel aggregate and electricity, firms are
heterogeneous in their productivity and fossil fuel intensity, and regions have varying degrees of clean
power. A social planner chooses the carbon prices for all regions to maximize national output subject
to an emissions target. I apply the model to the Canadian manufacturing sector and find that optimal
carbon taxes are highly fragmented. However, the costs of carbon tax harmonization are small, with a
0.05 percentage points difference in both regimes. The key to optimal carbon pricing lies in equalizing
the marginal output loss per unit of emissions for each region
