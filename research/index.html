	<p><span style="font-size: 26px">Are Uniform or Fragmented Carbon Taxes Optimal? Evidence
from Canadian Manufacturing (Draft coming soon!)</span>  </p>
  <p align="justify"> A uniform carbon tax applied to all emission sources is optimal when there are no other distortions.
Yet, observed carbon prices are highly fragmented both across and within countries, and multiple
market imperfections exist. Should jurisdictions work toward a global carbon price when markets
are imperfect? Using two confidential manufacturing plant-level datasets spanning 18 years in
Canada, I document large and persistent differences in the relative carbon tax-inclusive price of
electricity to fossil fuels across both space and time. Based on these findings, I build and estimate
a quantitative model where firms choose their energy mix of fossil fuels and electricity. Firms are
heterogeneous in their productivity and fossil fuel intensity, and regions have varying degrees of
clean power. I apply the model to the Canadian manufacturing sector to estimate the impact of
carbon taxes on emissions and output. I find that uniform carbon prices do not equalize marginal
abatement costs across regions, implying that the optimal tax is not uniform. However, while op-
timal carbon taxes are highly fragmented, the costs of carbon tax harmonization are small, with
only a 0.05 percentage point difference in output across both regimes.  <br>

        <p> Green Financing Under Credit Constraints. Theory and Plant-level Evidence </p>
  <p align="justify"> In countries where political factors or institutional constraints impede the passing of carbon pricing regulations, 
	  it may be more feasible to introduce non-pricing instruments, such as green subsidies and financing, 
	  to incentivize producers to reduce emissions. There is an extensive empirical and
	  theoretical literature that studies the impact of financial market imperfections on firm performance,
	  both domestically and in export markets. However, only a few papers incorporate climate change
	  and specifically analyze the impact of alleviating financial frictions in green investments. I fill
	  this gap by first documenting the associations between firm-level economic and environmental
	  performance indicators as well as financing constraints. I then use these facts to build a tractable
	  model that can be mapped to the data to analyze the effects of carbon taxes and credit constraints
	  on emissions and output.
