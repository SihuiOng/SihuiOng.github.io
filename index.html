     Hi there, I am Sihui Ong. I'm a second-year Ph.D student in Economics at Queenâ€™s University, Kingston. I am interested in macroeconomics and monetary economics. 
	Prior to my PhD, I was involved in the Jean Monnet co-funded <a href="https://politicsir.cass.anu.edu.au/centres/ces/research/projects/jean-monnet/eu-australia-trade-services/" target="_blank">Trade in Services Project</a> 
	at the Centre for European Studies at the Australian National University.</p> 
	

	<p>I received my Bachelor of Economics (Honours) from the Australian National University. </p>
